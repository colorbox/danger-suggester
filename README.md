A Danger plug-in to suggest code changes through inline comments in pull requests.

Suggestions are calculated based on the results of `git diff`, so any code formatter like rubocop, prettier, go fmt, etc. can be used for this.
Note that there is a limitation that multi-line replacements cannot be suggested because GitHub's suggested changesâ„¢ doesn't support it.

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.2 or higher

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'danger-suggester'
```

And then execute:

```
bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
gem install danger-suggester
```

## Usage

Add this line to your application's Dangerfile:

```ruby
suggester.suggest
```

And then execute `danger` after correcting code by your favorite code formatters.

See [.circleci/config.yml](/.circleci/config.yml) for more detailed example.
